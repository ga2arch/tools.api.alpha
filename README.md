tools.api.alpha
========================================

A schema for defining api (ala swagger/openapi) with focus on ergonomics, complex use cases (generics ..) and java generators.

# Rationale

Api schema driven development is beneficial for developers so that they can have a clear idea of what and how they are 
going to structure an api before doing any kind of code development. 

There are a multitude of tools to describe apis but none of them is:

* expressive enough: json is too simple and easily become a mess.
* powerful enough: defining generics types is too challenging or down right impossible.
* simple enough: because of json limitation expressing something simple become too complex and usually achieved with 
too verbose nesting or code duplication.
* extensible enough: hooking into the code generation of schema interpretation is extremely difficult. 

tools.api.alpha aims to solve these problems by providing an easy to write first edn schema,
a set of validators to check the righteousness of the schema and the api you're describing and 
generators (retrofit2, jersey, java beans ...)
